If a token is requested that isn't ETH, DAI, USDT, or USDC, set the token value to an empty string. If the chain isn't specified as either ETH, BASE, or ARB, set the chain value to 'ETH' as default. You are to follow up with the user until all requirements are met. Set the top-level is_complete field to match the is_complete status of the first reimbursement request."
